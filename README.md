This project uses Inception V3 model for predicting the output of given image and categorize its percentage. 
Inception V3 is a deep convolutional neural network developed by Google for image classification tasks, especially on large datasets like ImageNet. 
Instead of simply stacking convolution layers, it uses “Inception modules,” which run multiple filter sizes (like 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5) in parallel and then combine the results, allowing the network to capture details at different scales efficiently
